# Snake Game

In this project, you'll get some practice with C coding by creating a playable snake game. If you're not familiar with snake, [you can try out a demo at this link](https://www.xarg.org/project/html5-snake/). Please follow directions bellow:

1. Clone this repo
```sh
     git clone https://github.com/cpro-iiit/snake-project-starter
```
     
2. Attempt the tasks mentioned in [https://cs61c.org/fa24/projects/proj1/#conceptual-overview] and make changes to only `src/snake.c`, `src/state.c`, and `src/custom_tests.c`.
   
3. Run the following commands locally to see how your code is doing.
```sh
   make run-unit-tests 
   make run-unit-tests-<1 to 6 except 2>  
   make run-integration-tests
```

## Using Git

We just need very basic knowledge of git. You may go over the links below.

- [Git Videos](https://git-scm.com/videos)
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/): You can go over chapters 1,2,3 (mostly we will only need 2).

## Using Make

You will not need much knowledge of make for the project, since the makefile is already given to you. You will
not be required to change it unless you are doing something very advanced. The following reference is provided to help you understand how it works. Knowing it would be helpful in the future.
